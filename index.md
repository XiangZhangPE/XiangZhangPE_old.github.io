## About Me

I'm a <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/epower/" target="_blank"> Power Electronics</a> M.A.Sc. candidate at <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/" target="_blank"> Queen's University</a>'s <a href="https://engineering.queensu.ca/ece/" target="_blank"> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>,<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  --> working under the mentorship of <a href="https://engineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/praveen-jain" target="_blank">Dr. Praveen K. Jain</a>. My research involves coupled magnetics application in resonant converters, current sharing techniques of multiphase /multimodule converter, and high precise digital control.
<!-- 
In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems. -->

Prior to joining the M.A.Sc. program, I completed my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Wuhan University</a> advised by  <a href= "https://scholar-google-com.proxy.queensu.ca/citations?user=Hl9QqZIAAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank"> Dr. Meng Huang</a>. 

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

<!-- 
Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling. -->
